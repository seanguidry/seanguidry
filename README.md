HELLO I am SEAN, a noob developer who minds his own business most of the time.
I'm mainly a musician and decided I want to learn how to make audio plugins. 
Since I'm new and know the value of a good community, I've decided my first plugins will be distributed through github so I can get better with time via help from you guys!
I hope whoever reads this will understand progress starts from somewhere and - at the time of writing this - I am still a complete novice.

:to future endeavors:
